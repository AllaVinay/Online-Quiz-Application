# 💡 Simple Quiz App

Hey there! 👋
This is a fun little quiz app I built using plain **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It shows one question at a time with multiple choice answers, and there's a 10-second timer ticking down for each question — so no time to Google! 😉

I made this mostly to explore how timers, DOM manipulation, and interactive UIs work together in vanilla JavaScript. It’s fully responsive and works well on mobile too.

## 🚀 What it does

* Shows multiple-choice questions one at a time
* Each question has a **10-second timer**
* You can only select **one answer**
* It moves to the next question automatically if time runs out
* At the end, it shows your **final score**
* You can **restart the quiz** with one click

## 🔍 Highlights & Features

* ✅ **Multiple Choice Questions**
  Straightforward 4-option MCQs with only one correct answer.

* ⏱️ **Timer**
  Each question gets 10 seconds. The timer resets as the next one loads.

* ⚡ **Instant Scoring**
  Score updates instantly, and you get your result at the end.

* 📱 **Mobile Friendly**
  I used simple responsive CSS so it works on phones and tablets too.

* 🧠 **Optional API Support**
  You can easily plug in the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/) to load random questions.

## 🧩 How it works (in plain terms)

1. You hit the **Start Quiz** button.
2. A question pops up with 4 answers.
3. You’ve got 10 seconds to answer — the clock’s ticking!
4. If you get it right, your score goes up.
5. If you’re too slow or get it wrong, it just moves on.
6. At the end, you get your total score and an **Exit** button.

That’s it — simple, clean, and works in any browser.

## 💡 Why I built this

I wanted to create something fun and functional using just basic web technologies — no frameworks or libraries. The idea was to make a quick quiz game that could be expanded later (like adding difficulty levels, categories, or even highscores with local storage).

---

## 📦 How to run

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
3. You’re ready to quiz!

No need for npm, servers, or builds — just good old-fashioned HTML/CSS/JS.

## 🧪 Ideas for the future

* Add categories (e.g., science, history, sports)
* Let users choose difficulty (easy/medium/hard)
* Save high scores using localStorage
* Fetch random questions using an API
